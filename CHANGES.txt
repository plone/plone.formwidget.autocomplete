  [lentinj]

1.2.1 (2011-05-16)
------------------

* Use full widget name in ++widget++ path, don't try and remove form prefix
  (which will not behave correctly if widget is part of a subform).
  [lentinj]

1.2.0 (2011-04-30)
------------------

* Add upgrade step to register formwidget-autocomplete.js, bumping profile
  version to 1
  [lentinj]

* Split input:radio adding function so the code can be reused when adding
  in plone.formwidget.contenttree
  [lentinj]

* Move the javascript callback to real code, so instances of the widget
  can be added to the page by cloning existing widgets
  [lentinj]

* Allow overriding of the autocomplete URL
  [lentinj]

* Fix htmlDecode to return an element, not the nodeValue of an element which
  is null.
  [ggozad]

* No longer include the `demo.zcml` by default, but rather allow users to
  include it if needed.
  [hannosch]

* Update distribution metadata.
  [hannosch]

* Remove direct `zope.app` dependencies.
  [hannosch]

* Use the correct ViewPageTemplateFile from Five required in a Zope 2 context.
  [hannosch]

1.1.1 (2011-02-11)
------------------

* Explicitly include CMFCore's zcml in demo.zcml, for compatibility
  with Zope 2.13.
  [davisagli]

1.1 (2010-08-25)
----------------

* Force the inserted HTML radio buttons to be interpreted as HTML
  instead of text.
  [dukebody]

* Fall back to the site to perform content-related operations if the
  context is not wrapped into an aquisition chain.
  [dukebody]

* Compute the view name as the request URL left-stripped the content
  absolute URL.
  [dukebody]

* Use the same display template for single- and multi-selection:   
  The single selection display template was non functional before.
  The value of a single selection field is wrapped in a list anyways
  so the multiselection template renders the single selection field
  just fine.

* Update widget in the autocomplete-search browser view:
  The self.context.update() call rebinds to source which previously
  was only bound during traversal. This avoids problems with
  sources that only work after security is applied.
  [gaudenzius]

1.0 - 2010-04-19
----------------

* Issue 107: plone.formwidget.autocomplete: problems in IE8 when changing value
  Added a JavaScript work around, which dechecks all existing radio fields before
  adding a new one which is checked.
  [jbaumann]
  
* Made the widget work properly in Zope 2.12.
  [optilude]

1.0b3 - 2009-06-29
------------------

* Fix security validator to work properly on add views and other views using
  namespace traversal (++add++...)
  [optilude]

1.0b2 - 2009-04-08
------------------

* Fix security validator to work with urls not including the @@ view name.
  [optilude]

* Made widget use getURL() instead of constructing URL from underlying
  view. This makes it work with complex traversal logic.
  [optilude]

1.0b1 - 2008-08-28
------------------

* Initial release
